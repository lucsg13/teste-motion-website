# Connecting with GitHub Desktop

Since you have GitHub Desktop installed, follow these easy steps to upload your project:

1.  **Open GitHub Desktop.**
2.  Go to **File** > **Add Local Repository...**
3.  Click **Choose...** and select your project folder:
    `C:\Users\lucas\OneDrive\Documentos\TEST ANIMATED SITE`
4.  Click **Add Repository**.
5.  You should see "Current Repository: TEST ANIMATED SITE" (or similar) in the top left.
6.  Click **Push origin** (or **Publish branch**) in the top toolbar to upload your code to `teste-motion-website`.

> **Note:** I have already configured the remote link to `https://github.com/lucsg13/teste-motion-website.git` for you locally. If GitHub Desktop asks to initialize, just select "Add Local Repository" as valid git data is already there.
