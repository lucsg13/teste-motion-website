# Final Steps to Connect to GitHub

I have successfully:
1.  Configured your Git user: `lucsg13` / `lucasgomessoares13@gmail.com`
2.  Initialized the repository locally.
3.  Committed all your code.
4.  Added the remote link: `https://github.com/lucsg13/teste-motion-website.git`

## 🚨 Action Required: Create the Repo

Because the repository doesn't exist on GitHub yet, the push failed. You need to create it manually:

1.  Go to: **[https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)**
2.  **Repository name:** Enter exactly `portfolio`
3.  **Visibility:** Public or Private (your choice)
4.  Click **Create repository**

## 🚀 Push the Code

Once created, run this single command in your terminal VS Code:

```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe" push -u origin main
```

*(If that command fails due to authentication, try using GitHub Desktop or VS Code's Source Control tab to publish the branch.)*
